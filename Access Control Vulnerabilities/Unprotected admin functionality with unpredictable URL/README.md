## üîç Investigation

![Objective Screenshot](images/objective-screenshot.png)

During investigations, we should view the page source code to understand how does it work.

![Page Source](images/page-source.png)

We found a very interesting JS code. in short. The admin URL is disclosed in JavaScript on which constructs the user interface based on the user's role.

This script adds a link to the user's UI if they are an admin user. However, the script containing the URL is visible to all users regardless of their role!

## üö® Exploitation

Look closely at line 46, here it says -_if the current user is an admin_- an element (a) will be created linked with `/admin-qhjgwh` so on click it will redirect you to the admin panel page.

We have **accessed the admin panel** simply by typing `/admin-qhjgwh`at the end of the URL, bypassing any login requirements. This exposed a critical flaw, allowing an attacker to perform privileged actions, such as deleting the `carlos` user.
