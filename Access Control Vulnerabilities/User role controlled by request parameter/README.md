This is a brief write-up of the 3rd **APPRENTICE** access control lab from PortSwigger Web Security Academy.

## üß© Challenge Information

![Challenge Screenshot](images/challenge-screenshot.png)

Click the **‚ÄúAccess the Lab‚Äù** button to launch a temporary website created for your account.

**Objective**:  Locate an unprotected admin panel and delete the `carlos` user.

## üîç Investigation

While observing requests using burp, the cookies are sent to the server with an admin value set to `false` as we are logged in as normal user. 

![Investigate Requests](images/investigate-requests.png)

Send it to the repeater so we can test whether changing the value to `true` will return code `200 OK `or `304 FOUND`.

![Test Repeater](images/repeater-test.png)

It worked! the server checks the admin privilege using only cookies admin value. which is a dangerous vulnerability.

## üö® Exploitation

Bypassing role controlled by request parameter and accessing admin panel needs some steps:
	1- Visiting `My account` page as Weiner.
	2- Turn on interception mode.
	3- Reload the page 
	4- Edit the `cookie`header on every request send.  

Enable interception and refresh the page. Then edit the cookies header to set `Admin=true` as we did at repeater then forward the request.

"Admin Panel" appeared at the page, Click on it while the interception is on.

![Editing Header 1](images/exploiting2.png)

Edit the cookies header to `Admin=true` again then forward the request.

 Congrats on accessing the admin panel! 
 A few more steps needed to delete `carlos` account.

 *Don't forget, we are still intercepting requests.*
 After clicking "Delete" for `carlos` account, edit the cookies header again.

 Exploitation accomplished successfully!

 *This lab demonstrated how manipulating the request parameter controlling user roles can escalate privileges, reinforcing the need for server-side role validation.*
